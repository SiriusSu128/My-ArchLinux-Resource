# Introduction

- Zafiro-nord-icon-MOD nord is a fork of the icon pack zafiro-nord-black, I add more icons for Gnome Desktop and change some applications' icons.
- The dotfiles.zip contains my configurations of mpv, kitty and nvim. You can move the mpv and kitty folder to your ~/.config to use them.

## Installing

   - Download and unzip the Zafiro-nord-icon-MOD.zip and move the folder of icons to `~/.local/share/icons` (in user mode) or `/usr/share/icons` (in root mode).
   - The icon theme will be in the Gnome Tweaks for select.
